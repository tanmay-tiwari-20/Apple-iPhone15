# Apple iPhone 15 Pro Website Clone

This project is a recreation of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro website, combining GSAP animations and Three.js 3D effects to deliver a rich, interactive experience. The project helped me learn about the challenges of creating 3D models and using Three.js, while following a tutorial from JavaScript Mastery for guidance.

## 🌟 Features

- **3D Product Showcase**: Created with Three.js to render and animate 3D models.
- **Smooth Animations**: Utilized GSAP for animations, including scrolling effects and dynamic content.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing on various devices, maintaining Apple's sleek design aesthetics.
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and animations to enhance the user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and animations.
  - **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For smooth animations and motion effects.
  - **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: For scroll-based animations and interactions.

## 🚀 Usage

Explore the website to see the 3D animations, interactive elements, and smooth scrolling effects.
This project is ideal for learning how to implement 3D models and advanced animations in web development.
